# Land Better Jobs Launcher

Are you tired of tab-hopping to copy LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter/Blog links and digging for your resume every single time you apply? Not anymore.

Meet **Land Better Jobs Launcher** — your job-app sidekick. Keep every profile link in one tidy popup, copy with one click, and upload/attach your resume straight into job forms. Faster applications, less friction, more shots on goal.

2) Add your links and upload your resume.  
3) Copy links with one tap; hit **Attach** to drop your resume into file fields.
